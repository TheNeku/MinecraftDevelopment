[üõ†Ô∏è] Minecraft Development

Welcome! This repository showcases all my Minecraft-related projects.
Please note that not all source code will be publicly available. Most of the plugins here are developed for the Minecraft servers I work on.

Some plugins will be released in full or partial form, while others will remain concepts and prototypes, especially if I decide to take on custom plugin commissions.
(If you're interested, feel free to reach out!)
