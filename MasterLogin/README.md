📊 Key Features

👤 Player Management

Instant blocking of cracked accounts using premium usernames (if a player attempts to log in with a premium name but a cracked UUID, access is immediately denied).

Mandatory registration for cracked players (the player must set a password upon their first login).

AutoLogin available only for verified premium players (ensuring zero risk of account theft).

60-second authentication timeout (if a player fails to log in within the time limit, they are disconnected automatically).

Session tracking to prevent exploits and suspicious reconnections.

🔀 Multi-Platform Support: Proxy & Standalone Servers

🚨 Important Notes:

Proxy Version (Velocity/BungeeCord): Supports automatic server switching after login.

Spigot/Bukkit Version: Does not support server switching (the player remains on the current server after logging in).



---

☁ Database & Security

🛠 User Management with MySQL and H2

✅ Supports MySQL for multi-server synchronization (recommended for Velocity/BungeeCord)
✅ Supports H2 for local databases with zero additional configuration (ideal for standalone servers!)

🚀 The plugin automatically creates all required tables! 🚀
Users do not need to create the database manually!


---

🎮 Commands & Permissions

CyberLogin includes a set of commands for managing registration, login, and account security:

🚨 Note:

Velocity/BungeeCord: Commands must be executed in the proxy.

Spigot/Bukkit: Commands are executed directly on the server.
